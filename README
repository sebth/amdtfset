amdtfset is a command-line utility to set and query the tear free
desktop option present in the AMD Catalyst graphics card driver (fglrx)
through the AMD Display Library (ADL).

amdtfset could for instance be used in a wrapper script to automatically
enable the tear free desktop option when playing a video. Here is an
example wrapper script for MPlayer:

	#!/bin/sh
	amdtfset on
	mplayer "$@"
	amdtfset off

For information on how to install amdtfset, please see the included file
INSTALL.

amdtfset is a command-line utility to set and query the tear free
desktop option present in the AMD Catalyst graphics card driver (fglrx)
through the AMD Display Library (ADL). It allows the user to enable and
disable tear free desktop without having to start Catalyst Control
Center and without having to restart X (which is the case with
aticonfig).

amdtfset could for instance be used in a wrapper script to automatically
enable tear free desktop when playing a video. Here is an example
wrapper script for MPlayer:

	#!/bin/sh
	amdtfset on
	/usr/bin/mplayer "$@"
	amdtfset off

For information on how to install amdtfset, please see the included file
INSTALL.
